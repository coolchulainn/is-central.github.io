## Intro

In IS5, all competetive strategies can be divided into two overarching styles based on the item they choose at the F1 encounter "Fated Encounter", namely either Lamp of Wishes and Talons of Hatred. These items are so strategy-defining that tournaments allow players to restart their run if they did not get the encounter, and it's common for tournaments to demand that teams have an equal spread of Lamp and Talons players. Understanding Lamp and Talons is the first step to understanding all other aspects of IS5 strategy.

The core difference between the two can be boiled down to this: With Lamp, you have a very predictable power progression, but you're restricted in what operators you can draft and what nodes you can take if you want to stay on schedule for this progression. With Talons your progression is more unpredictable, but you reap more rewards overall, and are less restricted in your drafts. 

## Lamp of Wishes

The main effect of Lamp of Wishes is that refreshing a node gives a high chance of turning it into a Wish Fulfilled, and Wish Fulfilled nodes have extra options that offer certain collectibles based on your current status, including Hand collectibles, King's collectibles, and ingot-based ASPD collectibles. This makes it very easy to guarantee getting a strong build by fulfilling these conditions, meaning that Lamp players will always have a clear gameplan on how to become strong enough to win. Simply lower your LP by entering nodes with Toil, refresh a node here and there, and pick up your full set of King's collectibles. 

A big restriction of Lamp comps is that you want to avoid drafting 6* operators who use more than one type of Hand collectible. This is because the Lamp will always prioritise offering you a Hand collectible for any 6* operators you recruited who don't have their matching Hand yet, which will delay you from getting to pick up the King's collectibles that actually give you your power spike. If the Hand in question also has a book with a matching name, Lamp will give you *that* one too before moving on to the King's set. This makes certain operator subclasses significantly more or less desirable for Lamp strategies. Drafting operators of multiple Hands and messing up your Lamp progression that way is called handmixing.

Let's say I'm starting my run with Rosmontis. Rosmontis is a Flinger, meaning she uses the Hand of Rumble, arguably the strongest Hand. If I enter a Wish Fulfilled with Rosmontis as my only 6* that corresponds to a Hand, it will give me a Hand of Rumble, and then the next Wish Fulfilled will start giving me King's collectibles if my LP is at 1. However, if I recruited Archetto between the first and second Wish Fulfilled nodes, the second Wish Fulfilled will instead give me the Hand of Fireworks for Marksman Snipers, and only give me the King's New Lance starting from the third Wish Fulfilled. If I had picked up Goldenglow instead of Archetto, my Wish Fulfilled nodes would give me Hand of Undulation second, then Broken Wand - Undulation third, and only *then* the King's collectibles. If I'd picked up old school W though, my second Wish Fulfilled would give me King's New Lance right on schedule, because W and Rosmontis share a Hand.

- Note that only 6* operators will prompt a Hand from Lamp. You can recruit 5* of any subclasses you like without messing up your Hands.

Lamp also makes it easy to guarantee an obscene amount of ASPD buffs through Coin-Operated Toy, Golden Chalice, and the ingots gained from robbing the shop. This means operators that scale well with ASPD have significantly more value in both IS5 in general and Lamp comps in particular
